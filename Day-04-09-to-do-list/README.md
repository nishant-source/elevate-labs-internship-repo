# Day 02 – To-Do List App

This is the second task of my **Elevate Labs Web Development Internship**.  
The goal was simple: build a small To-Do list app using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

---

## What this app does

- You can type a task in the input box and press **Add** (or just hit Enter) to create a new task.
- Each task gets a little **× (close button)** on the right side so it can be removed.
- Clicking on a task itself **toggle it as done / not done** (adds a line-through of the task that shows that taks is done or not).
- Actually, just adding the "close class" will add the close btn and make it working

## Files in this folder

- `index.html` → The main HTML page with input, button, and task list.
- `style.css` → Styles for the app (dark theme with hover effects, checked tasks, and lot of).
- `script.js` → The logic for adding, deleting, and marking tasks complete.
- `README.md` → You’re reading it right now.
- `Screenshots (folder)` → The folder which have screenshots (desktop and mobile preview).

## How I approached this

1. Created a simple HTML layout with an input box, button, and list.
2. Styled it with CSS to make it look clean and dark-themed.
3. Wrote JavaScript to:
   - Listen for button clicks and Enter key.
   - Add new list items.
   - Add a cross button in the end of each item.
   - Toggle “checked” class when clicked.

## How to run it

Just open `index.html` in any browser.

## Reflection

This task was a good refresher on **DOM manipulation** and **event handling**.  
I also learned how to hide scrollbars with CSS while keeping the scroll working,  
and experimented with a dark + neon color scheme for better visual effect.
