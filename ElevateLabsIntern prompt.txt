write the task 2 questions, so, I can paste them in interview-questions.txt file in Day-02 folder, yesterday you write something like that - 

What is semantic HTML? → HTML that uses meaningful tags (<header>, <section>, <footer>) to describe content.  How does CSS Flexbox differ from Grid? → Flexbox = one-dimensional (row or column). Grid = two-dimensional (rows and columns).  What are media queries? → CSS rules that apply only on certain screen sizes or conditions.  How do you make a website responsive? → Use relative units like %, vh, em, rem, px( it is defined unit, not use this), flexbox/grid (will automatically adjust), media queries, and test on different devices.  Explain the box model. → Every element = content + padding + border + margin. (It is important to understand).  What is the difference between classes and IDs in CSS? → Class = reusable (use many times). ID = unique (use once).  How can you optimize CSS for performance? → Minify CSS, remove unused styles, use shorthand.  What is the difference between relative and absolute positioning? → Relative = positioned relative to itself.  Absolute = positioned relative to nearest positioned parent.  How does the z-index property work? → Controls stacking order. Higher z-index = appears above lower ones.  What is the difference between padding and margin? → Padding = space inside element (between content and border).  Margin = space outside element (between elements).
