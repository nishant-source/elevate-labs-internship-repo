# Elevate Labs – 30 Days Web Development Internship   

This repository contains all my daily tasks and projects completed during the Elevate Labs Web Development Internship (30 Days Program).  

## Overview  
- The internship provides one new task each day.  
- Tasks are focused on **front-end development** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- Along with the coding work, the internship also shares **interview preparation questions, resources, and roadmaps**.  
- Every day’s work is kept in a separate folder (`Day-01`, `Day-02`, `Day-03`, etc.), so progress is organized and easy to track.
